<p>Annotated Text Format Builder (ATFB) is a JavaScript module for converting various text formats to an annotated text format suitable for processing by the LanguageTool server.</p>
<p>This is just a playground for a proof of concent and may move to a better home if it looks useful.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><a href="https://languagetool.org">LanguageTool</a> is an <strong>excellent</strong> open source spell and grammar checker. It’s being integrated into more and more IDEs so that developers can leverage it alongside their other tools. However, LanguageTool’s creator has explicitly stated, <a href="https://forum.languagetool.org/t/rules-for-markdown/374/2">“LT only works on plain text, so you’ll need to either convert Markdown to plain text first, or tell LT what the markup is.”</a> Pretty clear.</p>
<p>Tdhis makes perfect sense. LanguageTool is meant to parse and analyze natural languages, not computer languages.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>So what are the goals here? Glad you asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a simple, lightweight parser in JavaScript.</li>
<li>Be portable across editors that leverage JavaScript in their plugins.</li>
<li>Map various formatting languages to the simple Annotated Text format described in LanguageTool’s API.</li>
<li>Use this readme as a test document.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and because we shouldn’t assume the text ends with text, here’s a link to one of my favorite quotes by Socrates: <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/socrates_125872">“I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing.”</a></p>
